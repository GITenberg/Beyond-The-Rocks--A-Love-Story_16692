description: "Beyond the Rocks is a 1906 novel by Elinor Glyn. The novel was later\
  \ adapted into a 1922 silent film in which Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino\
  \ (credited as Rodolph Valentino) starred together for the only time. The film was\
  \ directed by Sam Wood and distributed by Paramount Pictures.\nThe novel's title\
  \ comes from a conversation in Chapter 4 about the nature of Fate, where the main\
  \ character expresses belief that \"if one does one's best some kind angel will\
  \ guide one's bark [on the river of life] past the rocks and safely into the smooth\
  \ waters of the pool beyond.\" Frequently thereafter, the characters long for angels\
  \ who will steer them \"beyond the rocks.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
